We won't make you implement any tests for this challenge, 
but we still want to see how you think about testing your code. 

If you WERE to implement tests for your function, what cases would you test?

List each case below in plain english with it's expected result. 

For example...
Case: user a views user b's recording x for the first time
Expected Result: recording x uniqueViewCount increases by 1 & user b's uniqueRecordingViewCount increases by 1

Case: user a views user a's recording y for the first time
Expected Result: recording y uniqueViewCount increases by 1 & user a's uniqueRecordingViewCount increases by 1

Case: user a views user b's recording x for the second (or more) time(s)
Expected Result: Nothing is changed in the database.

Case: a non-logged in user (no viewerId given) views recording x
Expected Result: Throws 400 error

Case: user a views a non-existing recording z for the first time
Expected Result: Nothing is changed since recording z does not exist.

Case: user a views user b's recording x for the first time on two separate devices at the same time
Expected Result: recording x uniqueViewCount increases by 1 & user b's uniqueRecordingViewCount increases by 1. No double counts.
